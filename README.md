Themes & Scripts for the Rofi Launcher

  For my themes to work, as of sept 15, 2017 you need rofi from github
  rofi -v                                                                                            Version: 1.3.1 - 1.3.1-790-ge9c31ed7 (makepkg)


# Installation
    - cd into the folder containing the .rasi theme files

    - sudo cp *.rasi /usr/share/rofi/themes/

    Run rofi-theme-selector and alt+a to accept

# For the scripts

    You will need to have installed
    - greenclip (clipboard)
    - surfraw (websearch & bookmarks)
    - libqalculate (calculator)

    To install
    - cd into the folder containing all the scripts
    - sudo cp rofi* /usr/bin/

    run rofi-launcher

    - they can all be easily modified to change the placement & look
