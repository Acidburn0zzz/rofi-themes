# rofi-themes
Themes I've made for the Rofi Launcher

These should be placed in either /usr/share/rofi/themes/ or /usr/local/share/rofi/themes/

# Installation
    - cd into the folder containing the .rasi theme files

    - cp *.rasi /usr/share/rofi/themes/

    Run rofi-theme-selector and alt+a to accept

# For the scripts

    You will need to have installed
    - greenclip (clipboard)
    - surfraw (websearch & bookmarks)
    - libqalculate (calculator)

    To install
    - cd into the folder containing all the scripts
    - sudo cp rofi* /usr/bin/
    - run rofi-launcher

    - they can all be easily modified to change the placement & look
